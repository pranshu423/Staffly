# Dependencies
node_modules
package-lock.json
# (Keep package-lock if you want version consistency, but usually ignored in some workflows. Standard is to KEEP it. I will keep it in repo by NOT ignoring it, unless user asked? User said "sensitive info". node_modules is heavy, .env is sensitive.)
# I will only ignore node_modules and env.
